# MerkleMountainRange
Golang version of [this](https://github.com/zmitton/merkle-mountain-range)

The plan is to have the exact same API. Both packages use a fileBaseddb adapter that can interface with the same database format (the database is just a file).

This golang version is still being made however (Javascript one works now).
